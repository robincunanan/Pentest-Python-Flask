# Penetration Test Python Flask Framework

In this assignment this will demonstrate an attempt to break the Flask web framework by using internal, external, and black box testing. The scope of our goal will be to expose user or network design vulnerabilities such as Login, DNS, SSH, or in the Application build itself. The process will include the implementation of several effective tools from Debian-based Linux OS such as Kali or Parrot OS designed to discover and exploit any vulnerabilities in our Hello World web application running on Flask web framework. We will provide a conclusory report of our findings regardless of success or failure by the deadline.
