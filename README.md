# Pentest-Python-Flask
CNA340 Final Project

Project Proposal: Pentest Python Flask

Objective: Expose vulnerabilities on the Flask Module by conducting a series of analysis and penetration tests.

Scope
We will attempt to break the Flask web framework by using internal, external, and black box testing. The scope of our goal will be to expose user or network design vulnerabilities such as Login, DNS, SSH, or in the Application build itself. The process will include the implementation of several effective tools from Debian-based Linux OS such as Kali or Parrot OS designed to discover and exploit any vulnerabilities in our Hello World web application running on Flask web framework. We will provide a conclusory report of our findings regardless of success or failure by the deadline.
